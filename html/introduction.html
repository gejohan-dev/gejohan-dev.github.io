  Hi! My name is Johan and I'm 29 years old. I was born in Gothenburg and live there together with my girlfriend and three cats. I work as a Software Developer. My private projects are "as-much-as-possible-from-scratch" <b>C/C++</b> applications, mostly game engines. Feel free to check out my <a href="/resume" class="page-link resume-link">Resume</a> and <a href="/portfolio" class="page-link portfolio-link">Portfolio</a>. I'll probably start uploading some demos to this site in the future and do some write-ups of the things I found interesting while working on my projects.
